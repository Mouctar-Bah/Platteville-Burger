# Platteville-Burger
Platteville Burger has been offering take-out service. Recently, there is always a long line for take-out during the lunch hours. The administration wanted to know the average wait time for the customers who use the take-out service, so they can better improve the service. You are going to write a simulation program to help the administration find out the information.     
You are given a set of input data, which represents the customer visits during a typical lunch hours. The input data should be implemented as follows. 
      A      – customer arrive the take-out window   
	    L      – customer complete the order and leave       
      C n    – forward the clock by n time units  
      S    	 – print the current statistics for the simulation. 
      Q    	 – stop the simulation 
You will use the input data to find out the following information: 
•	Average wait time  
•	Total wait time 
•	Number of customers that did not have to wait 
•	Number of customers completed the order
